# DigitalComp_Project

Purpose of the program:
The program asks the user to enter package details such as height, length, width, weight, and distance. It also checks whether the item is fragile. Based on these details, the program compares the package size and weight with the limits of different delivery vehicles. Then, it will select the most suitable vehicle, calculate the delivery fee, and show a delivery summary to the user. Finally, the program allows the user to confirm or cancel the order. This helps users avoid choosing the wrong vehicle, reducing delivery issues and ensuring the package fits the service limits.
